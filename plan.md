## General Idea
* Focus on basics of github pages and markdown.
* Show possibility of getting more complex with programming language specific possibilities, which may not be appropriate for OpenRes, but for exploration later on.


## GitHub + Markdown
* GitHub Basics
	* Account
	* Repo
	* Uploading files
		* Show git versioning
	* Store and Share Code
		* Forking, downloading, Commenting through issues
* Markdown 
	* Basic README.md example + Basic Markdown syntax
		* Heading; dot points; links; images
	* github flavoured markdown -> syntax highlighting
	* Using github pages
		* Settings to make github page
		* appropriate file names - index / readme
		* Themes (Jekyll)
		* linking to other pages


## Figshare
* Basic introduction to figshare
	* For larger data (and larger file sizes)
	* Give data a DOI (useful for citations)
	* Free
	* Unimelb account is better


## Python and R (and Matlab?)
* Basic idea that markdown, as above, supported and used by these other coding environments too.
* Or, taking it further, can generate a file, such as HTML, that can live on github and be easily viewed.


### Python
* Save as HTML / Rendered on GitHub 
	* NBViewer as an alternative.
* [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
	* HTML
	* HTML + Template (Plugins)
	* slides 


### R
* RStudio Tools [webpage with tutorial and docs](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)
* RMarkdown
* Knitr + Code insertions -> HTML files
* Notebook (?)
* Slides and other Magic (?!)


## Going Further
* For Demo purposes
* Dashboards (Shiny, Dash, HTML widget and plug ins)
* Javascript and web dev
